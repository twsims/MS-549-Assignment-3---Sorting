Summary of Quick Sort Vs Merge Sort,,,,,
Algorithm,Best Case,Worst Case,Memory Usage,When best to use,Example
Quick Sort,O(n log n),O(n^2),Low ,When memory is limited and input size is moderate,Embedded systems like Car HUDs or smaller devices
Merge Sort,O(n log n),O(n log n),High ,When you need external sorting and strong stability,Large Data sets especially on external hard drives or other disks
,,,,,
Some of the differences between the to algorithms is the quick sort divides the array into smaller partitions around a arbitrary pivot which can lead to instability in the sort.  The merge sort always splits the array in equal halves which allows for consistent performaces but requires larger memory usage.,,,,,
